# recvsms - use free sms services through cli

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/courtier/recvsms.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/courtier/recvsms/pkg/recvsms) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/courtier/recvsms)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/courtier/recvsms)

You can think of recvsms as yt-dl for free sms services. It will support many SMS "backends" eventually. It also doubles as a sms receiving library.

## Goals:
- Support as many services as possible
- Clean implementation and library
- Easy to use GUI
- Lightweight

## TODO:
- Add more backends
- Make an actually working program
- Separate recvsms library from the actual program
