# recvsms - use free sms services through cli
You can think of recvsms as yt-dl for free sms services. It will support many SMS "backends" eventually. It also doubles as a sms receiving library.

## TODO:
- allow users to pass their own http clients to the backends (to allow the use of proxies, timeouts etc.)
- implement default timeout
